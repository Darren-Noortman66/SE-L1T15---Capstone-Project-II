# Simple Python Game


* **What is this repo or project?**

    This project is used to run a python game/ challenge.
* **How does it work?**

    This project works with python only and is executed using the 'pygame - Compulsory Task.py' file. The other files are image files used to make the program run. Simply use the arrow keys to move the character in the chosen direction.
* **Who will use this repo or project?**

    This project has not really been made for anyone except for my mentors at Hyperion-Development. (Hyperion-Dev Project)
* **What is the goal of this project?**
    
    This project is meant to run a simple Python game where you play as a germ. The goal of the game is for you (the germ) to get to the right side of the window without any of the cleaning touching you. If a cleaning product's image touches you germ image, then you lose, otherwise you win.


## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.

Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .py, such as PyCharm. (If you don't have one installed.)
Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'pygame - Compulsory Task.py' file. This is the execution file for the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you see images appear on the screen. Simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character in the chosen direction.

To test your input/ code, you can check to see if the game is over when you touch a cleaning product or get to the right side of the window.


## How you can help

No help is needed right now, as this task is complete(I am doing research for a more complicated game I can make). However, if you do see improvements that can be made, then please feel free to point them out :D
